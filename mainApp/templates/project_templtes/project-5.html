                <p>
                  The majority of population in rural centers and Tier 4 and 3 cities in India have to rely on various modes of transportation and makeshift ambulances to reach superspeciality care centers only available in Tier 2 and Tier 1 cities. A huge chunk of cases from Tier 3 and 4 cities, and rural areas are regularly recommended to these super-speciality care centers. Most often, critical cases perish during transportation between these centers due to lack of proper ambulances and medical resources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  An ambulance-based IoT patient healthcare monitoring system between the primary healthcare centers in Tier-3,4 cities and rural areas to secondary and tertiary healthcare facilities in Tier 1 and 2 cities is proposed. The patients being transferred via these special ambulances would be kept under constant supervision at both the source and destination hospitals throughout their transportation. Additionally, this ambulance-based patient monitoring system will be equipped with smart recommender systems, which, in cases of emergencies during transport, will be able to reroute the ambulance to the nearest hospital or point of care with the requisite infrastructure to immediately handle the patient's affliction. As one of the aims of this work is to provide affordable transportation during medical emergencies, the proposed system will have portable wireless body area networked sensors, which can be placed on the patient, turning any vehicle equipped with this system into a semi-ambulance. However, on the downside, if the vehicle is not a proper ambulance, emergency equipments such as defibrillators, anti-shock kits and oxygen cylinders may not be always available. It is in these cases that the recommender system will be able to minimize the patient's discomfort and ensure his/her safety during transportation.
                </p>

               

                <p>The main features of this system are envisioned to be:
                  <ul>
                    <li> <b>Continuous monitoring of various physiological parameters while transported in ambulance:</b>  The proposed system utilizes wireless body area sensors and equipment that are mounted on a patient's body to sense various physical stimulations. These nodes collect information and transform them into digital readings.</li>
                    <li> <b>Remote monitoring of patients:</b> This system thrives on advanced wireless communication technology with body sensor nodes as active participants. The gathered information concerning the patient's health is sent to a cloud framework. Healthcare data analytics helps the doctors at the destination hospitals to easily access the analytics and cater any suggestions upon detection of irregularity.</li>
                    <li> <b>Recommender system corpus development:</b> The more is the data content, the better and reliable is the recommendation. The corpus can be acquired from online directory listings, government reports, subscribed hospitals and registered doctors.</li>
                    <li><b>Reroute the ambulance to the nearest hospital with the requisite infrastructure:</b> According to the patient condition, the immediate equipment requirement for undergoing several tests and their availability with the nearby hospitals would be suggested by the system. With the assistance of route recommender systems (Google maps), the ambulance driver would reroute the same to the nearest hospital.</li>
                    <li><b>Real-time route planning:</b>In accordance to the healthcare analysis result (how critical is the condition of the patient) the proposed recommender system would re-plan the route. The real-time route planning would also consider the traffic condition. Based on the severe criticality, the driver would be suggested to take the route with less traffic to reach the destination.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p>
                  <ul>
                    The proposed system has three main components:
                    <li>GPS-based route planning
                      </li>
                      <li>Traffic congestion control and signal scheduling
                        </li>
                        <li>Rerouting for congestion avoidance</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <p> The development of highly flexible and intelligent networks, which offers large amounts of bandwidth-on-demand, is required for broadband communications over dynamically changing networks. This will enable the delivery of multimedia communications instantly and transparently anytime and anywhere. WASN, which have relatively recently gained popularity due to reasons such as their infrastructure-less setup and administration, ease and low-cost of deployment, have the potential to significantly contribute to this goal. Ad hoc networks are of different types â€“ mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have mobile nodes, ad hoc wireless sensor networks (WSN), in which the nodes are sensors capable of sensing various environmental information and other events around them. The sensor networks can also have either stationary or mobile nodes in them.</p> 

                 <p>In typical WASN, especially in MANETs, there is a cooperative engagement of nodes with potential for continuous change in infrastructures, without the requirement for the presence of centralized network managers, access points, fixed base stations, or a backbone network for controlling the network management functions. They do not possess designated routers for making routing decisions. All nodes in such networks take part in routing by acting as routers for one another. However, several hops are normally needed in such networks for transmission of data from one node to another because of the limited wireless transmission range of operation of the mobile nodes.</p> 
                  
                  <p>The above-mentioned characteristics of WASN, particularly those arising due to the mobility of nodes (if any), and the potential for continuously changing network infrastructures in the absence of centralized network managers and access points, pose several challenges. It is typical that the routes that were once considered to be the "best", may no longer remain the same at a later time instant. This, therefore, requires a continuous re-computation of routes, and there is no permanent convergence to a fixed set of routes in such networks. This makes it challenging to learn the optimum set of routes. So, any routing protocol that needs to operate in WASN network environments should take these issues into consideration.</p>

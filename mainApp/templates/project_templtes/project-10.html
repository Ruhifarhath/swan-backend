                 The realization of wireless multimedia streaming from underwater environments - fresh water as well as marine environments, from an economic perspective is one of the most challenging domains in the Internet of Things (IoT), which is yet to achieve global standardization due to sparse attempts towards achieving full-edged underwater wireless communication. Various factors in underwater and marine environments such as multipath propagation, limited bandwidth, and channel time variations severely restrict the use of electromagnetic and optical modes of communication, which is considered the primary means of data transmission for terrestrial communications. Electromagnetic waves require large antennas for propagation and optical waves can be easily scattered, making them infeasible for use in underwater communications. Additionally, the changes in the conductivity of water, especially in coastal regions, increase the attenuation of electromagnetic waves during data transmission. Even though acoustic waves are considered the most reliable form of communication in underwater channels, there are many shortcomings associated with them, the principal one being multi-path fading caused by rection and refraction in water due to varying sound speeds at different depths, which results in inter-symbol interference (ISI) on the receiver side. Other critical factors affecting underwater coustic communication include path loss, ambient noise, and propagation delay. Addressing the challenges of underwater acoustic communication requires the adoption of complex modulation schemes and expensive hardware, which are mostly application specific Acoustic communication for underwater environments is a proven and reliable means of achieving wireless communication in these environments. The wireless control and communication between various underwater devices, vehicles and sensor nodes enable the formation of hassle-free, self-organizing and robust networking architectures. The recent rise in the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is further popularizing the use of acoustic means of communication in underwater environments. However, due to the underwater medium, additional issues such as the effect of passive node mobility and high delay may arise. Also, such network of UMSNs needs to be sparsely deployed in order to maintain cost-effectiveness. Therefore, a scheme is required to form the topology dynamically from the distributed sensor nodes such that the network's lifetime is maximized maintaining optimal connectivity.

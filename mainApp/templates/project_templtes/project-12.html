                  The project aims to develop a digital mine monitoring system using IoT that will make underground mine safer and increase the growth of production. The objective is to develop an integrated monitoring system for detecting hazardous gases, strata monitoring and strata fall prediction, mine fire detection, mine temperature, pressure, and humidity monitoring.
                </p>
                <p>The total coal reserve in India is approximately 264.535 billion tonnes. India has total 556 coal mines in which 164 opencast and 359 underground mines and 33 mixed mines. Underground mines are unsafe for miners working in the underground. Many accidents occur in underground mines because of suddenly increases hazardous gases ratio, roof, and side fall, mine fire etc. are some fatal accidents happen in underground mines and dumpers and trucks in opencast mines. These accidents are gradually increased in underground mines over the years. So monitoring and prediction of the accident are necessary for miners safety and production of coal. So for the growth of production of coal and minimization of accident happen in underground mines is necessary for real-time monitoring of coal mines with the help of virtual developed digital mine using Internet of Things (IoT).</p>
                <p>IoT is a technology in which objects are assigned with unique identifiers, and are given the ability to automatically transfer data over the Internet without human-human or human-computer intervention. In this technology, each object is assigned a unique IP address which is capable of transferring data over the network. The data is collected through infrared sensors, geographical information system (GIS), Radiofrequency identifier (RFID), or other information sensing equipment. In mining industry, IOT has a broad application domain, especially in applications, such as personal security scheduling, ventilation safety scheduling, ground comprehensive information, gas information (concentration, pressure and composition), miners positioning information, fault detection, hydrology monitoring, mine pressure, mine temperature, mine humidity, and geo-stress monitoring. IOT based digital mines are developed for information retrieval and information management of mining-related geological information, hazard information, and production information.</p>
               

                <p>Considering the existing problems of ehealthcare services, the following objectives is proposed in this project.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Development of a digital mine by uniquely identifying the objects under the mine and locating the same using GIS.</li>
                    <li>Retrieval and management of information related to mining, geological information, hazard information, and production information.</li>
                    <li>Development of real-time mine monitoring system that is capable of detecting rock mass deformation, explosion, mine fire detection, mine temperature, mine humidity, mine pressure and similar other dangerous phenomena associated with mines.</li>
                  </ul>
